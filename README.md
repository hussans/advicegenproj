**Description**: This React app generates random advice using the Advice Slip API, featuring a responsive card design that works on all devices. Built with functional components and hooks, it displays advice text with an ID, a decorative divider, and a button to fetch new quotes. Tailwind CSS ensures clean styling while maintaining the original design's layout and interactivity, with error handling for reliable operation. Components are organized in a dedicated folder, and all provided assets are implemented as required.
